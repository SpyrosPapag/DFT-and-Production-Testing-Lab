# VLSI DFT and Production Testing Lab

This repo contains the lab exercises for the course *"Special Topics In Digital Systems Design*" of the **Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics** in **University of Patras**.

## Overview
1. **Lab 1:** ATPG and Fault Simulation using Open-Source Tools (Atalanta, HOPE)
   - Focus on fundamentals of ATPG algorithms, fault models, and simulation coverage.
2. **Lab 2:** Industrial DFT Flow using Synopsys Design Compiler and TetraMAX
   - Complete flow from synthesis to scan insertion, ATPG and Fault Simulation.

## File explanation
1.	The folder *"Lab1-Atalanta&Hope"* contains the first lab exercise.
2.	The folder *"Lab2-Synopsys_Design_Compiler&TetraMAX"* contains the second lab exercise.
3.	The file *".gitattributes"* is used for handling large lab files(logs).

### In both lab folders(1,2) there are two pdf files:
- Questions: It contains the exercise description.
- Answers: It contains the solutions, as well as a detailed explanation of each exercise's files.
